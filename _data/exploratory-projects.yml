  abstract: "Tactile surface indicators (TSIs) provide ground-based tactile cues to help pedestrians who are blind or low-vision safely and independently navigate different environments. In this exploratory work, we examine how digital fabrication technologies such as 3D printing, CNC milling, vacuum forming, and heat transfer melting can enable the production of custom TSIs. To compare different fabrication approaches, we designed and evaluated a series of prototypes with varied surface materials and design features (e.g., bump height)."

  abstract: "We present <i>Fluxable</i>, a tool for making custom sensors and actuators 3D printable with customer-grade Stereolithography (SLA) 3D printers. With this tool, the user converts an arbitrary 3D model into a deformable body with integrated helix-and-lattice structures, which comprise a hollow helical channel in the center, lattice paddings, and a wireframe structure on the surface. The tool allows for the parameterization of the helix for sensing performance and customization of the lattice for actuation. By inserting a conductive shape-memory alloy (SMA) into a printed object through the helical channel, the converted shape becomes a sensor to detect various shape-changing behaviors using inductive sensing or an actuator to trigger movements through temperature control. We demonstrated our tool with a series of example sensors and actuators, including an interactive timer, a DJ station, and a caterpillar robot."

A11yBits includes (1) a series of Sensing modules to detect both environmental information and user commands, (2) a set of Feedback modules to send multi-modal feedback, and (3) two Base modules (Sensing Base and Feedback Base) to power and connect the sensing and feedback modules. The toolkit enables accessible and easy assembly via a 'plug-and-play' mechanism. BLV users can select and assemble their preferred modules to create personalized DIY-ATs."

  abstract: "In the context of dementia care-giving in India, caregivers have always been unsung heroes. However, there remains a dearth of comprehensive data regarding the emotional and physical challenges caregivers face in the Indian subcontinent. We present a qualitative study that delves into the realities of being a dementia caregiver in India, investigating caregivers' experiences and examining the impact of several challenges on their daily lives. In this study, we conducted interviews with four primary caregivers of persons with dementia to explore the impact of care-giving on their social lives, mental and emotional well-being. The findings highlight the importance of having an emotional outlet, a support system, and accessible resources for enhancing caregivers' quality of life. Drawing from these insights, we propose a set of design implications that can guide future endeavors focused on enhancing the overall well-being of dementia caregivers in India. This research addresses a significant gap in the understanding and support for dementia caregivers, providing valuable recommendations for supporting this crucial group of individuals."

  abstract: "We present our early work on sPrintr, a pipeline consisting of a mobile 3D printer and graphical interface to enable in-situ fabrication with consumer-grade hardware and fabrication tools. We prototyped two initial components of that pipeline i) a mobile 3D printer and ii) a user interface that helps users arrange, preview, and plan prints in their environment using a floor plan layout. We identify challenges in the automation of mobile printing systems, on-the-go printing, and human-machine interfaces for in-situ design and fabrication."

  abstract: "Blind and visually impaired (BVI) people can fetch objects in an acquainted environment by touching objects or relying on their memory. However, in a complex and less familiar situation, those strategies become less useful or even result in dangers (e.g., touching hazardous obstacles).We present PneuFetch, a light haptic cue-based wearable device that supports blind and visually impaired (BVI) people to fetch nearby objects in an unfamiliar environment. In our design, we generate friendly, non-intrusive, and gentle presses and drags to deliver direction and distance cues on BVI user's wrist and forearm. As a concept of proof, we discuss our PneuFetch wearable prototype, contrast it with past work, and describe a preliminary user study."

We discuss the design and preliminary exploration of a multi-modal and accessible approach for BVI developers to edit visual layouts of webpages while maintaining visual aesthetics. The system includes three parts: an accessible canvas, a code editor, and a controller that checks if the updates violate design guidelines."

  abstract: "Tactile overlays with audio annotations can increase the accessibility of touchscreens for blind users; however, preparing these overlays is complex and labor intensive. We introduce TacTILE, a novel toolchain to more easily create tactile overlays with audio annotations for arbitrary touchscreen graphics (e.g., graphs, pictures, maps). The workflow includes: (i) an annotation tool to add audio to graphical elements, (ii) a fabrication process that generates 3D-printed tactile overlays, and (iii) a custom app for the user to explore graphics with these overlays. We close with a pilot study with one blind participant who explores three examples (floor plan, photo, and chart), and a discussion of future work."

  abstract: "A common approach in creating haptic cues is moving the contact surface with electromechanical actuators such as vibrating electric motors, piezoelectric motors, or voicecoils. While these actuators can be configured to effectively convey rich information, their high frequency movementscould raise negative responses after lengthy exposure. PneuHaptic is a pneumatically-actuated arm-worn haptic interface. The system triggers a range of tactile sensations on the arm by alternately pressurizing and depressurizing a series of custom molded silicone chambers. We detail the implementation of our functional prototype and explore the possibilities for interaction enabled by the system."

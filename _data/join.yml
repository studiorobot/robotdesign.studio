  We are dedicated to creating an interdisciplinary team of researchers who are
  interested in human-robot interaction applied to health and the arts. We continuously seek students
  and researchers who are highly motivated, talented, and proactive. Robot Studio accepts students in
  Robotics, CS, EE, Mechanical, Information, Arts, and Psychology. Patricia supports each lab member
  holistically in their learning journey and career goals. Read [this article](https://robotics.umich.edu/academics/graduate/admissions/graduate-application/what-are-specific-faculty-looking-for-in-phd-applications/)

visiting_students_text: |
  We often have self-funded visiting students for the summer and (rarely) during the academic year. In
  these cases, usually, the student has some prior research experience, similar research interests,
  and there is a current project going on in Robot Studio where they would be a good fit. If you are a
  student living outside of the US and requiring a Visa, allow for (at least) 6 month period before
  the start date to account for visa processing. We recommend reaching out in December for a start
  date in May. If you are a self-funded student who wants to come join us for the summer, you should
  send an email to Patricia. We don't consider self-funded visiting students as "free labor" and strongly want to
  make sure that your stay is productive and a success for your career goals.

    description: "This project explores how robotic generative systems can be used to define an authentic creative process. Questions this project answers are: Can we trace authenticity during the production of a painting? When an artist creates a collaborative painting can the robot recognize authenticity markers and try to match them? Ultimately, can we create “labels of authenticity” that will support the copyright of real artists vs. art generated by genAI systems?"

    description: "This project focuses on integrating design research-based visioning methodologies to provide a strategic vision towards the future of Design for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). We aim to achieve the following overarching goals: to conceptualize what Design for HRI is; to scope the design methodologies, tools, and procedures necessary to create interactive robots; and to define evaluation strategies for design work conducted within the HRI field. The outcome will be a roadmap for the field of Design for HRI that spams 50 years."

    description: This project aims to build an understanding of post-incarcerated youth interactions with robotic systems to inform the design and preliminary evaluation of a social robot to support mental health.  We will build a new social robot to deliver mental health training and conduct community-based participatory research by including in the research team a community member with a similar experience and demographics as our target population. We expect robot interactions to facilitate youth’s-entry in society.

    description: Social Dining, or eating within a group, is a universal meaningful experience that brings people together. This project leverages foundational models to develop an assistive feeding system that can more efficiently understand the user and address their individual needs. By promoting independent eating, people with physical disabilities can take a seat in professional dinners that can advance their career, and feel comfortable accepting invitations to eat with a group of friends to strengthen social connections.

In this project, we aim to design a comfortable, safe, and intuitive touch interaction from the robot to the human during assistive scenarios. We aim to study what types of communication styles, embodiment factors, and touch parameters are best suited for an assistive robot that delivers care during medical and assistive needs.

We propose to answer the following questions: what do customers wish Astro could do beyond its current abilities? when living with Astro becomes a routine, how does their relationship shift? what are the special moments in a relationship with Astro? The outcome of this project is a framework with design tenets that promote lifelong robotic agency and companionship between families and Astro."

    description: This project aims to investigate if interacting with a creative collaborative assistant powered by foundational models can lead to the generation of creative droodle captions. Towards this, we will compare the droodle captions generated during the interaction with the creative collaborative assistant to the generated captions created as a result of a conversation with a human creative mentor. We will also explore the role of embodiment (computer and robot) in this setting to propel human creativity.

    description: This project aims to contribute to new design directions towards robots that can socially engage
      with children while imaging their eyes reliably. Eye imaging in pediatric patients is essential to diagnose and
      manage ocular diseases, but it is practically impossible to conduct due to their fear and aversion during the exam.
      In this project, we explore the design space of character design for a robot OCT system to make eye exams more
      fun for children.

    description: This project aims to design and develop an engaging social robot to capture real-time stress and mood data from teens, and to successfully deploy and evaluate the social robot in an urban, high school setting. As school populations increase, and mental health services decrease, gathering valid, real-time data via engaging technology may be an essential tool for assessing student health. Using a human-centered design approach, the project employs participatory methods to engage local teens directly in the design and testing of the robot.

Through metaphors, this project proposes new ways of using, relating to, and co-existing with the robots. By identifying assumptions, we provide a comprehensible list of aspects to reconsider regarding robots’ physicality, roles, and behaviors. Through metaphors, we propose new ways of examining how we can use, relate to, and co-exist with the robots that will share our future.

We explored how robots can promote positive group dynamics through board game scenarios. Contrasting to the typical one-robot one-­user paradigm in human-robot interaction, we studied the role of emotions and adaptation in interactions between a robot and a group of users.

This paradigm, known as “learning by teaching”, has the powerful effect of boosting their self-esteem. It engages them in a so-called “Protégé effect”: because they unconsciously feel that they are somehow responsible if the robot does not succeed in improving its writing skills, they developing their metacognitive skills and reflecting on their errors."

An empathic robot can adapt to the learning pace of children, supporting their process and at the same time challenging new curricula. Can an autonomous robot designed with empathic competencies foster collaborative learning in a group context? Can an empathic robot sustain positive educational outcomes in long-term collaborative learning interactions with groups of students?

  description: " It is said that “beauty is in the eye of the beholder” - but so is authenticity. With the advances of genAI, art is not only being produced by the “human hand” but also through software and hardware. When we blend genAI tools, such as Chat-GPT, with a robot that can paint, the result is a system that can create art that resembles human-produced. It thus becomes crucial to identify and measure the authenticity of the artwork production process. This project will explore how robotic generative systems can be used to define an authentic creative process. Questions this project aims to answer are: Can we trace authenticity during the production process of a painting? When an artist creates a collaborative painting can the robot recognize authenticity markers and try to match them? Ultimately, can we create “labels of authenticity” that will support the copyright of real artists vs. art generated by genAI systems?."

  description: '"Design for Human-Robot Interaction" is the area of work within the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) that embodies design work. This area has the potential for high impact as it incorporates diverse methods to build robots, with most methods being human-centric and honoring human values when designing robots. There have been increased calls for the HRI community to embrace "more exploratory design approaches familiar to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in HRI". However, the potential of Design for HRI has not been fully realized and outlined in the field. This project focuses on integrating design research-based visioning methodologies to provide a strategic vision towards the future of Design for HRI. We aim to achieve the following overarching goals: to conceptualize what Design for HRI is; to scope the design methodologies, tools, and procedures necessary to create interactive robots; and to define evaluation strategies for design work conducted within the HRI field.'

  description: In the US there are over 48,000 incarcerated youth with high levels of mental disorders and recidivism rates high. Research shows a link between better mental health in prison and post-release to lower these rates. Within juvenile justice systems, youth have access to mental health services but once they are released access is reduced or eliminated. Digital interventions are affordable and scalable but engagement is low and face-to-face physical interactions lead to more positive outcomes in mental health. Social robots are physical and can intelligently interact with people. This project will leverage social robots to close the gap between mental health access in post-incarcerated youth. We will build a new social robot to deliver mental health training and conduct community-based participatory research by including in the research team a community member with a similar experience and demographics as our target population.

  description: Social Dining, or eating within a group, is a universal meaningful experience that brings people together. It is also one of the most challenging contexts for People with Physical Disabilities (PwPD) to integrate. For the majority of PwPD, constantly facing social dining challenges amplifies their disability and as a result they tend to avoid dining with others. However, social dining is repeatedly present in our lives, both in social contexts (e.g., having a coffee with friends) and in professional contexts (e.g., a networking dinner in a conference). Assistive robotics has emerged as a promising technology to assist PwPD eating independently. By leveraging the conversation abilities of Large Language Models, we envision developing a system that can more efficiently understand the user and address their individual needs. By being able to eat independently, PwPD can more comfortably engage in professional dinners that can advance their career, or accept invitations to eat with a group of friends.

  members: Grace Pan
  data: 2024 - ongoing
  description: In Physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI), robotic touch and how to improve such physical interactions between people and robots has become an emerging field of study. The role of touch in humans has proven to be an important part of our development and many studies have indicated that human touch offers many benefits including improving mental and physical health, reducing stress and alleviating depression, and communicating cooperation and trust between people. These positive effects from touch may also be elicited from non-human agents like robots. In this project, we aim to design a comfortable, safe, and intuitive touch interaction from the robot to the human during medical emergency scenario. We aim to study what types of communication styles, embodiment factors, and touch parameters are best suited for an assistive robot that delivers care during a medical emergency.

  description: "Robots like Astro are designed to harmoniously co-exist with families at home. For continuous adoption, interactions between the device and families need to be engaging, meaningful, and useful. However, it is yet to be discovered how current Astro customers use the device at home. Long-term deployments of robots with users are notoriously difficult to conduct. This project aims to use publicly available data to study how current customers of Astro live with the device. Specifically, we propose to answer the following questions: what do customers wish Astro could do beyond its current abilities? when living with Astro becomes a routine, how does their relationship shift? what are the special moments in a relationship with Astro that mark a new and unique moment in their relationship? The outcome of this project is a framework with design tenets that promote lifelong robotic agency and companionship between families and Astro."

  description: While Large Language Models (LLMs) can be helpful in the generation and development of creative ideas, their ideas tend not to be novel, especially to people with high degrees of domain knowledge. By creating a collaborative structure inspired by classic creativity research, an LLM-based partner can be created to inspire and enhance creative work in humans. The outcome of this partnership is a combination of existing human and LLM creative skills. Despite its potential, online genAI tools tend to be disembodied. However, we know that when people interact with an embodiment agen (i.e., that has a physical body), people are more persuaded, engaged, and the memories over the conversation content lasts longer. In this project, we investigate the impact of an embodied agent, such as a robot, in enhancing people's creativity using genAI.

  data: 2024 - ongoing | DARPA Young Faculty Award
  description: "This project explores how robotic generative systems can be used to define an authentic creative process. Questions this project answers are: Can we trace authenticity during the production of a painting? When an artist creates a collaborative painting can the robot recognize authenticity markers and try to match them? Ultimately, can we create “labels of authenticity” that will support the copyright of real artists vs. art generated by genAI systems?"

  data: 2024 - ongoing | NSF EAGER
  description: "This project focuses on integrating design research-based visioning methodologies to provide a strategic vision towards the future of Design for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). We aim to achieve the following overarching goals: to conceptualize what Design for HRI is; to scope the design methodologies, tools, and procedures necessary to create interactive robots; and to define evaluation strategies for design work conducted within the HRI field. The outcome will be a roadmap for the field of Design for HRI that spams 50 years."

  members: Connor Williams, Leia Stirling
  data: 2024 - ongoing 
  description: This project aims to build an understanding of post-incarcerated youth interactions with robotic systems to inform the design and preliminary evaluation of a social robot to support mental health.  We will build a new social robot to deliver mental health training and conduct community-based participatory research by including in the research team a community member with a similar experience and demographics as our target population. We expect robot interactions to facilitate youth’s-entry in society.

  members: Atharva Kashyap
  data: 2024 - ongoing
  description: Social Dining, or eating within a group, is a universal meaningful experience that brings people together. This project leverages foundational models to develop an assistive feeding system that can more efficiently understand the user and address their individual needs. By promoting independent eating, people with physical disabilities can take a seat in professional dinners that can advance their career, and feel comfortable accepting invitations to eat with a group of friends to strengthen social connections.

  name: "TOUCH: Assistive Robot Touch during Medical Emergencies"
  members: Grace Pan
  data: 2024 - ongoing
  description: The role of touch in humans has proven to be an important part of our development. In this project, we aim to design a comfortable, safe, and intuitive touch interaction from the robot to the human during assistive scenarios. We aim to study what types of communication styles, embodiment factors, and touch parameters are best suited for an assistive robot that delivers care during medical and assistive needs.

  data: 2024 - ongoing
  description: "This project aims to conduct social media ethnography to study how current customers of Astro live with the device. We propose to answer the following questions: what do customers wish Astro could do beyond its current abilities? when living with Astro becomes a routine, how does their relationship shift? what are the special moments in a relationship with Astro? The outcome of this project is a framework with design tenets that promote lifelong robotic agency and companionship between families and Astro."

  members: "Trey Davis, Erfun Ackley, Peter H. Kahn Jr.,"
  data: 2024 - ongoing 
  description: This project aims to investigate if interacting with a creative collaborative assistant powered by foundational models can lead to the generation of creative droodle captions. Towards this, we will compare the droodle captions generated during the interaction with the creative collaborative assistant to the generated captions created as a result of a conversation with a human creative mentor. We will also explore the role of embodiment (computer and robot) in this setting to propel human creativity.

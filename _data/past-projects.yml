  description: This project aims to design and develop an engaging social robot to capture real-time stress and mood data from teens, and to successfully deploy and evaluate the social robot in an urban, high school setting. As school populations increase, and mental health services decrease, gathering valid, real-time data via engaging technology may be an essential tool for assessing student health. Using a human-centered design approach, the project employs participatory methods to engage local teens directly in the design and testing of the robot.

  description: This project explores the use of metaphors for generating novel ideas, reframing existing problems, and eliciting new perspectives of human-robot interaction. Through metaphors, this project proposes new ways of using, relating to, and co-existing with the robots. By identifying assumptions, we provide a comprehensible list of aspects to reconsider regarding robots’ physicality, roles, and behaviors. Through metaphors, we propose new ways of examining how we can use, relate to, and co-exist with the robots that will share our future.

  description: This project seeks to design, fabricate, and evaluate robots as creativity-provoking tools. By creating a social robot named YOLO (or Your Own Living Object) that promotes creativity during unstructured play, this project showed how creating a story with this robot evokes divergent and convergent thinking processes in children, leading to more original storylines.

  description: AMIGOS (means 'Friends' in Portuguese) is a project investigating the role of collaboration and competition in interactions between robots and humans. We explored how robots can promote positive group dynamics through board game scenarios. Contrasting to the typical one-robot one-­user paradigm in human-robot interaction, we studied the role of emotions and adaptation in interactions between a robot and a group of users.

  description: "This project explores how a robot can help children acquire handwriting, where children are the teachers who help the robot to write better. This paradigm, known as “learning by teaching”, has the powerful effect of boosting their self-esteem. It engages them in a so-called “Protégé effect”: because they unconsciously feel that they are somehow responsible if the robot does not succeed in improving its writing skills, they developing their metacognitive skills and reflecting on their errors."

  description: MODULAND is a project that creates an embodied and interactive music lesson in an urban space by turning playgrounds into music using our open-source materials. With MODULAND, playgrounds become modular synthesizers to raise curiosity, exploration, and connection to electronic music. MODULAND was created in 1-week during MIT Media Lab Berlin Workshop.

  description: This European FP7 project set the challenge to create empathic robotic tutors by researching how robots can respond to learners. An empathic robot can adapt to the learning pace of children, supporting their process and at the same time challenging new curricula. Can an autonomous robot designed with empathic competencies foster collaborative learning in a group context? Can an empathic robot sustain positive educational outcomes in long-term collaborative learning interactions with groups of students?

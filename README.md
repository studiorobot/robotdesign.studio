# How to Update the Lab Website Content

This README explains how to use Jekyll to update the lab website content.

---

## Local Setup
Before updating the lab website, you'll need to set up Jekyll locally.

### Install Jekyll
Follow the installation guide for your operating system from the official Jekyll website:
[Jekyll Installation Guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

### Clone the Repository
Clone the lab website repository to your local machine using the following SSH or PAT commands:

SSH:
``` bash
git clone git@github.com:studiorobot/robotdesign.studio.git
```
PAT:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/studiorobot/robotdesign.studio.git
```

### Navigate to the Project Directory: 
Move to the directory where the repository was cloned.

``` bash
cd robotdesign.studio
```

### Install Dependencies: 
Ensure you have all required dependencies installed by running:

``` bash
bundle install
```

### Run the Local Server: 
To view the website locally with live reload and automatic browser opening, start the Jekyll server:

``` bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload -o
```

By default, this will serve the site at http://localhost:4000/robotdesign.studio/ and automatically open it in your browser. Any saved changes you make will be reflected in the browser immediately.

## Homepage

The homepage data file includes the following sections:

### Carousel
The `carousel` section displays images and text on the homepage slider. Each entry includes:
- `title`: The heading for the slide.
- `description`: A short description (supports HTML for line breaks).
- `image`: The image file path.

```yaml
carousel:
  - title: multidisciplinarity
    description: Our work happens at the intersection<br>of robotics, design, and psychology
    image: carousel/fabrication.jpg
```

### Research Vision
The `research_vision` key holds a multi-line text block describing the lab's mission.

```yaml
research_vision: |
  Robot Studio is a multi-disciplinary research lab that designs current and future relationships between robots and us that are inspiring, refined, and magical...
```

---

## News

The `news` section contains updates about lab activities. Each entry includes:
- `date`: The date of the event.
- `description`: A description of the event. It supports Markdown links.

### Adding Links in News
To add a link, put the text you want to display in square brackets [], followed immediately by the link in parentheses (), with no space between them.

#### Example:
```yaml
news: 
  - date: January 9th, 2025
    description: Prof. Patricia launched a new class at the Robotics Department called "Human Evaluation of Robot Systems."

  - date: March 7, 2022
    description: Organized HRI 2022 workshop on [theory-grounded HRI](https://theoriahri.wixsite.com/theoria).
```

When the website is built, the Markdown links in the description will be rendered with the corresponding text and URL.


## Updating Content

1. Locate the appropriate data file (e.g., `homepage.yml` for the homepage).
2. Add or edit entries using the provided structure.
3. Use Markdown links for clickable text in the News section.
4. Save the changes. Jekyll will regenerate the site to include your updates.

## Structure of the Navigation Data File

The navigation data file is divided into two main sections: `internal` for internal navigation links and `external` for social media or external links.

### Fields in the Data File

1. **Internal Navigation (`internal`)**:
   - `title`: The text displayed on the navigation bar.
   - `url`: The relative URL for the internal page (e.g., `"projects"` for `/projects/`).

2. **External Links (`external`)**:
   - `platform`: The name of the external platform (e.g., "LinkedIn").
   - `url`: The full URL to the external platform.
   - `name`: Display name for accessibility or alternative use.
   - `icon`: Font Awesome class for the platform's icon.

---

## Example Data File Structure

```yaml
internal:
  - title: "projects"
    url: "projects"
  - title: "team"
    url: "team"
  - title: "publications"
    url: "publications"
  - title: "press"
    url: "press"
  - title: "join us"
    url: "join-us"

external:
  - platform: LinkedIn
    url: https://www.linkedin.com/company/robot-studio-design/
    name: LinkedIn
    icon: fab fa-linkedin
  - platform: GitHub
    url: https://github.com/studiorobot
    name: GitHub
    icon: fab fa-github
```

---

## Steps to Update the Navigation Bars

### 1. **Internal Navigation**
   - To add a new internal link:
     ```yaml
     - title: "about"
       url: "about"
     ```
   - Insert the new entry under the `internal` section.

   - To remove a link, delete its entry:
     ```yaml
     - title: "join us"
       url: "join-us"
     ```

   - Save the file and rebuild the site to reflect changes in the header and mobile navigation bars.

---

### 2. **External Links**
   - To add a new external link, append an entry under the `external` section:
     ```yaml
     - platform: Twitter
       url: https://twitter.com/studiorobot
       name: Twitter
       icon: fab fa-twitter
     ```

   - To remove an external link, delete its entry:
     ```yaml
     - platform: GitHub
       url: https://github.com/studiorobot
       name: GitHub
       icon: fab fa-github
     ```

   - Ensure the `icon` field uses a valid Font Awesome class.

---

## Notes
- **Order Matters**: The order of links in the `internal` section determines their order in the navigation bar.
- **Icons**: Ensure that the `icon` field matches the Font Awesome version used in the website.
- **URL Formatting**:
  - Internal links use relative paths (e.g., `"team"`).
  - External links use absolute URLs (e.g., `https://...`).

By editing this file, you can control the layout and content of the navigation bars and social media links across the website.

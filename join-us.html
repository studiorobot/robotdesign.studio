				<p style="color:#000;">We are dedicated to creating an interdisciplinary team of researchers who are
					interested in human-robot interaction applied to health and the arts. We continuously seek students
					and researchers who are highly motivated, talented, and proactive. Robot Studio accepts students in
					Robotics, CS, EE, Mechanical, Information, Arts, and Psychology.

					Patricia supports each lab member holistically in their learning journey and career goals. Read this
					article to understand what Patricia is looking for in a student application. Note that due to the
					volume of requests, Patricia is not able to respond to all unsolicited emails from prospective
					students. The best way to contact is to follow the guidelines below.

					We will be looking to accept one Ph.D. student for Fall 2025. Please follow the information on <a
						href="https://robotics.umich.edu/academics/graduate/admissions/" target="_blank">this
						admission website</a> by the deadline: December 1st, 2024. In the application system, select the
					name of
					Patricia Alves-Oliveira to show interest in working with us. After the application, Patricia will

				<h4>Undergraduate and Master Students</h4>
				<p class="authors">
					Current University of Michigan students are welcome to join Robot Studio for research credits.
					According to the projects that have openings, Patricia posts research openings in the mailing lists
					of the Department of Robotics, CS, EE, Mechanical, Information, Arts, and Psychology.

				<h4>Visiting Students</h4>
				<p class="authors">
					We often have self-funded visiting students for the summer and (rarely) during the academic year. In
					these cases, usually, the student has some prior research experience, similar research interests,
					and there is a current project going on in Robot Studio where they would be a good fit. If you are a
					student living outside of the US and requiring a Visa, allow for (at least) 6 month period before
					the start date to account for visa processing. We recommend reaching out in December for a start
					date in May.
					<br><br>
					If you are a self-funded student who wants to come join us for the summer, you should send an email
					to Patricia. We don't consider self-funded visiting students as "free labor" and strongly want to
					make sure that your stay is productive and a success for your career goals.
